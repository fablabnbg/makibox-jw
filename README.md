# makibox-jw
JÃ¼rgen's modded Makibox

Changes:

* New completely self designed Extruder. Mostly from handmade Aluminum parts.
  More force. That was needed to push filament through the original hotend.
  I definitly prefer aluminum to printed parts, when it comes to mounting the 
  M6 fitting of the bowden tube.

* New E3D V5 Hotend from an inexpensive chinese source. (ca 20 EUR)

* New clear acrylic housing. The original 1.5mm acrylic is way to fragile!
